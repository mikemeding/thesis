This is an template and example of the UMass Lowell thesis format. It is my Masters Thesis, which I have cut down and added narrative for you, the new author. I will explain the specific tricks of this toolchain as well as some basic LaTeX practices that yield good results throughout this document, while maintaining the look of a real research thesis. With that, I will often have an introductory paragraph or sentence for you, the student and new author, followed by some of my actual thesis writing, included for bulk text to make it look good. This is an abstract, so I shouldn't go on too much more. A few paragrpahs is good, but not to much.

Really, don't go crazy. It is hard, but you should be as sparse as possible. Mine had four little paragraphs, the size of the one above.
