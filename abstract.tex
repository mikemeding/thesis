3D printing currently contains a large gap between software and hardware. 
A hobbyist machine can now be purchased for less than \$500 but having good software to drive it is difficult to find. 
The only free options available are Cura and Repetier Host. 
Cura, has varied support on all platforms, and Repetier Host is intended only for Windows. 
The purpose of this research is to construct an open source, web based slicing software and make it simple for users without any prior knowledge of 3D printing to take advantage of their printer.
Thus, this sofware will make 3D printing much more approachable for users who are not computer savvy. 
Additionally, this opens up opportunities for educators in STEM programs to teach students about 3D printing in a simple and practical way.
