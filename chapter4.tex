\paragraph{}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:settings-data-flow}, the client side of this applicaiton has a lengthy flow of data.
This data flow starts with loading a static JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file which describes the settings in a pattern as shown in Listing \ref{lst:json-settings}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, label={lst:json-settings}, caption=A sample from a static settings file in JSON format.]
{
    "setting": "layer_height",
    "default": 0.1,
    "type": "float",
    "category": "Quality",
    "label": "Layer Height (mm)",
    "description": "Layer height in millimeters. This is the most important setting to determine the quality of your print. Normal quality prints are 0.1mm, high quality is 0.06mm. You can go up to 0.25mm."
}
\end{lstlisting}
