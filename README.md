LaTeX Thesis Template for UMass Lowell

Builds cleanly using TeXShop on MacOS X. Easily works in any reasonable LaTeX environment.

1. Run BibTeX first. It will parse the bibliography file, 'bibliography.bib' into a form usable by Latex.

2. Run LaTeX on 'main.tex' All other files are included in main. 

3. The Preface is not required. I invented that myself. It is commented out in 'main.tex'. If you would like to use the preface, simply uncomment it and edit the 'preface.txt' file.

Thanks to Mark Micire, from whom I got this toolchain. I have incrementally improved it, as I'm sure he, and all the stewards before him, also did.

The current rules for dissertation formatting which this template is intended to implement can (probably) be found here:
