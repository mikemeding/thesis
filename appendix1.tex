\chapter{If you need an Appendix}

If you need an appendix, make them here. You can copy this file so each appendix has its own tex file, or you can put them all in this one file. I don't care. Just keep yourself organized.

This file has great example of how to tables and graphics, so be sure to look at the source. The tables I use are ``professional style'' 

This file will probably not build as I did not include the graphics files in the template distribution.

Now, back to the content. Paper handouts were used in three of the activities to provide instructions and work space for the students. They are included here.

%I can also make these not full-page %by using the includegraphics instead of includepdf
%if that is better. It would allow for captions like normal images or the insert to be on the same page as its title.
