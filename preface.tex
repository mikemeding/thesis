\chapter*{Preface}
This research is an exploration in engineering education. My story leading to this research starts three years ago with a reading group on engineering and design where, as an undergraduate, I started learning about the current research in the field. Many of the foundational works of this study were first introduced to me in that reading group. I then spent two years working hands-on with middle school students and design activities. In an after-school program, I was a mentor for groups of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders, and provided them with experience in constructing and programming robots and robotic devices. This program covered many different concepts, from basic electricity to functional software design. Recently, I have been a part of a proposal writing process that exposed me to many different models of design, and showed me that there are significant and seemingly incompatible variations among many of them. From here my first concept for this research was conceived: to build a model of the design process as observed in middle-school students. %Keep original goal
This would be useful in the field of engineering education not just as another model, but as a tool to understanding this specific age of students.
