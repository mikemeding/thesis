Acknowledge those who helped you. I offer no comment on proper degree of mushiness. The work in this thesis was only possible because of all the helpful and guiding members of the UMass Lowell engineering education community. Many people have helped me not just in research effort, but in introducing me to new thoughts and ideas that became foundational to this project.

I would like to first thank someone for being so inclusive towards me. She involved me in her work, where I learned about many of the foundational works that appear in this document. It was not just about getting sources for the literature review, it was about having an experienced colleague.  She taught me that everything is always a learning process, for students, teachers, and researchers alike.
