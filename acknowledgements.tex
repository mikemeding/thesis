\paragraph{}
 The work in this thesis was only possible because of all the helpful and guiding members of the UMass Lowell Computer Science community. 
 Many people have helped me not just in research effort, but in introducing me to new thoughts and ideas that became foundational to this project. 

\paragraph{}
This research would not have been possible without the helpful guidance of Professor Fred Martin who's passion for education has been a constant source of inspiration.
I would also like to thank Kelsea Gildawie for all the late nights spent helping me put my thoughts on paper.
It would not have been possible to finish this research without her help.

\paragraph{}
I also wish to acknowledge my parents Uwe and Sally, without whom getting a masters degree would not have been possible in the first place.
