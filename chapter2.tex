\chapter{Background}

This chapter has been cut down significantly as this is just a template. You should write a LOT more than is here.

Education has evolved with culture and technology.  Classical wisdom calls only for the ``three R's" (reading, writing, and arithmetic) in schools, which today is considered foundational but insufficient for life. 

\section{Brief History of Engineering Education}

STEM education, of which engineering is a component, is in need of ``evidence-based" tools to measure their effectiveness \citep{csed-guzdial}. Conversely, lab-generated scientific data on education is often too abstract to be directly usable for real teachers \citep{sandoval}.

\section{Design Activity Studies}
	\label{sec:activity-design-studies}
\citet{welch} performed an experiment on design activities
carried out by seventh grade students. The steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Understand the problem
\item Generate possible solutions
\item Model a possible solution
\item Build a solution
\item Evaluate the solution
\end{enumerate}

This paragraph shows how to use a label. A model-eliciting activity (MEA) is \label{sec:MEA}
designed such that the students' product is not a single
answer, but a rule or process that can be applied to solve similar
problems.

\section{This Study}
Many studies have examined the design process, providing a variety of insightful models and theories.
