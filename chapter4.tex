% TODO: describe settings code and how it works in far more detail
\paragraph{}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:settings-data-flow}, the client side of this applicaiton has a lengthy flow of data.
This data flow starts with loading a static JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file which describes the settings in a pattern as shown in Listing \ref{lst:json-settings}.

% JSON settings example listing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, label={lst:json-settings}, caption=A sample from a static settings file in JSON format.]
{
    "setting": "layer_height",
    "default": 0.1,
    "type": "float",
    "category": "Quality",
    "label": "Layer Height (mm)",
    "description": "Layer height in millimeters. This is the most important setting to determine the quality of your print. Normal quality prints are 0.1mm, high quality is 0.06mm. You can go up to 0.25mm."
}
\end{lstlisting}

A directive called curasettings takes this static JSON file and splits it up so that for each setting object a field can exist in the template.
AngularJS provides this functionality through the use of an ng-repeat which is written in a similar fashion to that of a for loop in Python.

%TODO: include listing of sample ng-repeat from template.
%TODO: talk about data binding with settings object
